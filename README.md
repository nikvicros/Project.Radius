# NG4.Project.Radius
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0

We are using `MongoDB`, `ExpressJS`, `Angular 4` and `NodeJS`.

## System Requirements
Install the latest version of NodeJS ( https://nodejs.org/en/ ). Will be used primarily for installing and updating project dependecies throught NPM. 

## Getting Started
1. Install the Angular 2 / 4 official CLI ( https://cli.angular.io/ ) globally. Follow instructions on the Angular.io website.
2. Download or clone this repo. 
3. CD into the project folder and run `npm install` to download all project depedencies.
4. Once NPM install is complete, run `ng serve` and wait for the CLI to compile the 100% of the application. 
5. Type: localhost:4200 in your preferred browser

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
